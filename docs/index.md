## refCNV Source Code

With exception of some utility scripts and external dependencies (e.g. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)) the following projects provide the vast majority of the software (from database interaction to website) behind Progenetix and Beacon<span style="vertical-align: super; color: red; font-weight: 800;">+</span>.

### [`bycon`](https://github.com/progenetix/bycon) and [`byconaut`](https://github.com/progenetix/byconaut)

- Python based service based on the [GA4GH Beacon protocol](http://beacon-project.io)
- software powering the Progenetix resource
- [Beacon<span style="vertical-align: super; color: red; font-weight: 800;">+</span>](http://beaconplus.progenetix.org/) implementation(s) use the same code base

### [`refcnv-web`](https://github.com/progenetix/refcnv-web)

- website code  for the refCNV implementation
- provides Beacon interfaces for the `bycon` server, as well as other Progenetix sevices (e.g. the [publications](http://progenetix.org/publications/) repository)
- implemented as [React](https://reactjs.org) / [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project
- contains this documentation tree here as `mkdocs` project, with files in the `docs` directory
